## 📜 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides intelligent answers to questions about the Bhagavad Gita. By combining the power of Google's Gemini AI with a carefully engineered information retrieval system, it delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses drawn directly from the sacred text.

The system parses the PDF of the Bhagavad Gita, intelligently divides the content into meaningful chunks, generates semantic embeddings, and uses advanced retrieval techniques to find the most relevant passages for any query. This approach ensures that answers are grounded in the actual text rather than fabricated.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Architecture Overview

This system implements a modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1. **Document Processing**:
   - Extracts text from the Bhagavad Gita PDF using PyPDF2
   - Preserves chapter and verse information for accurate citations
   - Splits text into semantically meaningful chunks using LangChain's text splitter

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Creates vector representations of each text chunk using HuggingFace embeddings
   - Stores these embeddings locally with metadata in JSON format
   - Indexes all chunks for fast retrieval

3. **Query Processing**:
   - When a user asks a question, their query is converted to an embedding
   - The system performs similarity search to find relevant text passages
   - Metadata about the chunks helps in providing accurate citations

4. **Answer Generation**:
   - Selected text chunks are sent to Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM
   - Custom prompts guide the model to create accurate, contextual answers
   - Citations from the original text are preserved in responses

5. **User Interface**:
   - Offers both command-line and web interfaces
   - Provides easy access to follow-up questions and expanded explanations
   - Includes references to specific verses for transparency

### Technical Components

- **Vector Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to find relevant text chunks
- **Local Storage**: Implements an efficient file-based vector store without requiring databases
- **Responsive Design**: Web interface adapts to different screen sizes
- **Reference Tracking**: Keeps track of which text segments were used to generate answers

## 🔍 Example Questions

Here are some questions you can ask the Bhagavad Gita assistant:

- "What does Krishna say about dharma?"
- "Explain the concept of karma yoga"
- "How should one deal with grief according to the Bhagavad Gita?"
- "What is the meaning of 'Aham Brahmasmi'?"
- "How does the Gita describe the ideal person?"
- "What are the three gunas mentioned in the Gita?"

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Customizing the System

You can modify the system's behavior by adjusting parameters in the following files:

- **Chunk Size**: In `chunks.py`, modify `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` to change how text is divided
- **Model Preferences**: In `llm_ai.py`, adjust temperature and other parameters to control answer style
- **UI Customization**: Modify `static/styles.css` to change the appearance of the web interface

### Command Line Arguments

The application supports several command line arguments:

```powershell
# Run in web mode
python app.py --web

# Run with debug logging
python app.py --debug

# Reprocess the PDF (if you changed the source document)
python app.py --reindex

# View help
python app.py --help
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The RAG system can be integrated with other applications:

```python
from chunks import LocalChunkStorage
from llm_ai import get_gemini_llm

# Initialize the storage
storage = LocalChunkStorage("data_blocks")

# Get the LLM
llm = get_gemini_llm()

# Ask a question
response = storage.query_with_sources(llm, "What is karma yoga?")
print(response)
```

## 📜 About the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It consists of a conversation between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. The Gita addresses the concepts of dharma (duty/righteousness) and yoga (the path to realization and self-discovery) among other spiritual, ethical, and philosophical topics. It is considered one of the holy scriptures for Hinduism and has been commented upon by numerous philosophers and scholars over the years.
